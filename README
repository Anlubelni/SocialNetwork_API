# SocialNetwork_API

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over the last part of this 
course, we use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications 
is data, it’s important that we understand how to build and structure the API first.

This project is meant to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. 
We used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and 
[Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages.
